REGRESSION CODE EXPLANATION

1.The first step is to import all necessary Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and plotting. Pandas is used for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for plotting, and Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
2.The dataset is loaded using Pandas read_csv function. The file path is specified to read the forest fires dataset.
3.Features and target are defined. The target variable is the area burned by forest fires. All other columns are considered features.
4.Since the dataset contains categorical variables, one-hot encoding is applied. This converts categorical variables into numerical format by creating binary columns for each category. Drop_first is set to true to avoid multicollinearity.
5.The regression target, area, is converted into a binary variable. This means we consider whether a fire occurred or not. If area is greater than zero, it is labeled as one, otherwise zero.
6.The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. 80 percent of the data is used for training and 20 percent for testing. Random_state is set to forty-two to ensure reproducibility.
7.A Random Forest Regressor is initialized with 200 trees, maximum depth fifteen, and minimum samples required for a split as five. This is done to optimize the model and target around eighty-five percent accuracy.
8.Three regression models are initialized: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor. Gradient Boosting has a learning rate of 0.1 and max depth of three. SVR uses radial basis function kernel with C as one and gamma as 0.01.
9.A plot figure is created to compare the ROC curves of the models.
10.Each model is trained using the training data. Predictions are made on the testing set. Although these models predict continuous values, we can still compute ROC curve by treating higher predicted values as more likely to indicate fire occurrence.
11.False positive rate and true positive rate are calculated for each model using roc_curve. AUC is calculated using the auc function to evaluate model performance.
12.The ROC curves for all three models are plotted on a single graph. A diagonal line represents random guessing for reference.

CLASSIFICATION CODE EXPLANATION

1.Necessary libraries are imported. Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Matplotlib for plotting, Scikit-learn for preprocessing, machine learning models, and evaluation metrics.
2.The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
3.Column names are cleaned by stripping extra spaces.
4.Columns DC and FWI are converted to numeric. Any invalid entries that cannot be converted are set as missing.
5.Rows containing missing values are dropped to ensure the dataset is clean for training.
6.The target variable Classes is encoded as numeric. Fire is labeled as one and not fire is labeled as zero.
7.Features are selected by removing the target column from the dataset. X contains all independent variables and y contains the target.
8.The dataset is split into training and testing sets with eighty percent for training and twenty percent for testing. Random state is set to forty-two for reproducibility.
9.Standardization is applied to the features using StandardScaler. This ensures all features have mean zero and standard deviation one, which improves model performance, especially for models like SVM and Logistic Regression.
10.Three classification models are initialized: Decision Tree Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classifier. SVM is set with probability equals true so it can provide probability predictions required for ROC analysis.
11.Models are trained on the training set using the fit method.
12.Probability predictions are obtained using predict_proba for each model. Only the probability of class one (fire) is used for ROC calculation.
13.ROC curves are calculated for each model using roc_curve function. False positive rate and true positive rate are obtained.
14.AUC is calculated for each model to measure overall performance. Higher AUC indicates better classification ability.
15.ROC curves are plotted for all three models. A diagonal reference line represents random guessing.
16.Error metrics can be computed by predicting the class labels using predict method. This allows you to calculate mean squared error, mean absolute error, accuracy, or other metrics as needed.
If you want, I can also rewrite the regression section to explain why it is unusual to use regressors for ROC curves in a humanized note-friendly way, because that is something your lecturer might ask about.

Do you want me to do that?
